# System Analysis Report: Self Brain AGI System

## 1. Current State Assessment

### 1.1 Architecture Overview
The Self Brain AGI system has a comprehensive architecture designed to support advanced general intelligence capabilities. It consists of 19 different models managed by a central coordinator, with a Vue.js frontend and FastAPI backend.

### 1.2 Key Components
- **Model Registry**: Manages 19 different AI models including manager, language, audio, vision, spatial, sensor, computer, motion, knowledge, programming, planning, emotion, finance, medical, prediction, collaboration, optimization, autonomous, and value alignment models.
- **AGI Coordinator**: Central component that manages and coordinates all cognitive components.
- **Training Manager**: Supports both individual and joint training of models, with from-scratch training capability.
- **System Settings Manager**: Handles persistent storage and access to all system settings.
- **Unified Cognitive Architecture**: Provides the framework for cognitive processing.
- **Self-Learning System**: Enables autonomous learning and knowledge integration.

### 1.3 Implementation Status
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3-based interface with pages for home, training, knowledge, and settings.
- **Backend**: FastAPI-based server with WebSocket support for real-time communication.
- **Models**: Most models have placeholder implementations or basic structures but lack complete functionality.
- **Training**: From-scratch training is enabled but not fully implemented.
- **External API Integration**: Basic framework exists but requires完善.
