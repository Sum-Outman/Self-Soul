- [ ] Analyze duplicate functions in spatial models and develop a merge strategy
- [ ] Merge core/models/spatial/model.py and core/models/spatial/stereo_model.py
- [ ] Analyze duplicate functions in vision models and develop a merge strategy  
- [ ] Merge core/models/vision/model.py and core/models/vision/image_model.py
- [ ] Delete duplicate model files
- [ ] Update model registry to reflect merged models
- [ ] Test functionality integrity of merged models
- [ ] Verify system startup and model loading works normally

## Spatial Model Merge Strategy
- Keep SpatialPerceptionModel as the main class
- Integrate real-time input interface functionality from StereoVisionModel
- Merge object detection and tracking algorithms
- Unify API interface

## Vision Model Merge Strategy
- Keep VisionModel as the main class
- Integrate advanced image processing functionality from ImageVisionModel
- Merge external API support
- Unify emotion generation functionality
